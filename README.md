# Phrase guessing game

## Initial project
This project started out as a graded project for Treehouse TechDegree - Front End Web Development. The aim was to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation with a phrase guessing game and it was a great challenge and built my confidence in JavaScript.

## Improvement
Months later, I was learning back end and changed the way the phrases are generated. I created a server side random phrase generation hosted by Heroku and some aesthetic improvements like animations and added definitions and examples of the phrases. I stuck with the original theme of animal idioms for the phrases and added more phrases.

I followed along on the [#100Devs course lecture](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1316131994) to set up the Heroku API.

I wrote the meanings and examples of phrases with help from google. The [English Like a Native](https://englishlikeanative.co.uk/30-animal-idioms/) page provided the lion's share of the guidance for the phrases.
