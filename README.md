# Phrase guessing game

## Initial project

This project started out as a graded project for [Treehouse TechDegree - Front End Web Development](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development). The aim was to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation with a phrase guessing game and it was a great challenge and built my confidence in JavaScript.

## Improvement

Months later, I moved the phrases from the client side to the server side hosted by Heroku. I also made some aesthetic improvements like animations and added definitions and examples of the phrases. I stuck with the original theme of animal idioms for the phrases and added more phrases, increasing the original five to twelve.

**Update Aug 2022:** I moved the server to Firebase as Heroku was withdrawing its free hosting. I also added two new phrases and improved the mobile layout although tablet and desktop screens still offer a better user experience.
